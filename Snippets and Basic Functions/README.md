# Snippets and Basic Functions

More often than not, basic operations of most embedded projects are the same - logging data, reading it back, plotting it, doing an FFT, etc.
This space contains snippets and basic functions that can be re-used or easily modified for any project.

## Arguments Parsing

Easily implement code that accepts run-time parameters.

## File Operations

Read and write data in different formats.

## Signal Processing

Simple codes to post-process data.

## XML

I like to work with XML wherever configurations have to be stored or used. Sample code available for parsing XML.
