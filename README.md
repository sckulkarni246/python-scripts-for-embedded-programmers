# Python Scripts For Embedded Programmers

Once in a while, I write python-based host scripts during the course of my work or personal projects. Some of these tasks are:
1. Communicating with embedded systems over some bus
2. Performing some kind of simple signal processing - moving average, FFT, etc.
3. Writing and reading data to and from log files and then plotting it
4. Parsing XML files that represent some configuration
5. <many more!>

I am sharing here some code snippets and full-fledged applications that have enabled me to do that over the last few years. These range from extremely basic to somewhat complex codes.

*I generally use **Python 3.x** and would recommend the same to anyone who wants to use these codes.*
